# Godot F# Tools

A Godot Engine plugin to simplify using F# through the C# Mono language.

## Features

- Generating an F# project file and adding it to your Godot C# project/solution
    - via Tools menu shortcut.
- Generating an F# script from a selected C# script.
    - via Tools menu shortcut.
- Automatically Generating F# scripts from all C# scripts.
    - via configuration in ProjectSettings under Mono > F# Tools
    - Note: All F# classes must have the same name as their C# counterpart with an "Fs" on the end, e.g. `MyClass.cs -> MyClassFs.fs`.

## How to install

1. Download the .zip from GitHub or clone the repository.
2. Copy/paste the `addons` directory into your project or create a symlink between the `addons/godot-fsharp-tools` directory and a similar one in your project.
3. Open the ProjectSettings, go to the Plugins tab, find "Godot F# Tools" and switch it from "Inactive" to "Active" on the right-hand side.
4. Make sure that you've installed the Mono version of Godot and the [dotnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x) command line tool of which this plugin makes heavy use.

## How to use

These instructions assume that you...

1. Have already created a C# project/solution by first creating at least one C# script in your Godot project.
1. Have installed and activated the plugin.

### Generate F# Project

1. Go to `Project > Tools > Setup F# project...`. A dialog will open.
1. Fill in the necessary fields. Unnecessary fields will tell you what default value they become if left empty.
1. Once confirmed, the dialog will generate the F# project and connect it to your C# project/solution for you. This may take a short while.

### Generate single F# script from a C# script

1. Go to `Project > Tools > Generate F# script from C# script...`. A dialog will open.
1. Fill in the necessary fields. Unnecessary fields will tell you what default value they become if left empty.
    - The namespace must match that of the F# library project to which you plan to add it.
1. Once confirmed, the dialog will generate the F# script and update the C# script to inherit from your F# class and include its namespace.
1. You will need to add the new F# script file to your F# library project manually.\*

### Generate F# scripts from all created C# scripts

1. Go to `Project > ProjectSettings`. Go to the `General` tab. Scroll all the way to the bottom and find the `Mono > F# Tools` category.
1. Fill in information for all fields in this section.
    - The namespace must match that of the F# library project to which you plan to add it.
    - For better organization, we recommend using the F# library project directory for the output directory.
1. Create a C# script. The editor will generate a corresponding F# script in the output directory and update the C# script to inherit from your F# class and include its namespace.
1. You will need to add the new F# script file to your F# library project manually.\*

\* The reason you must do this manually is because...

1. the `dotnet` tool from Microsoft does not support adding items to projects ("Really? Seriously? Professional stuff here guys").
1. Godot's `XmlParser` class only allows you to read XML nodes, but not insert them into an .xml file ("Really? I mean, that could be useful guys...").
1. If you want to write your own XML parsing code to inject the file reference into the `<ItemGroup>` tag hierarchy, it would be appreciated.

For the uninformed, you add an existing item to an F# project in the following way:

1. Have Visual Studio installed with F# support.
1. Open the Godot .sln file in Visual Studio.
1. Right click on the F# library project in the Solution Explorer dock.
1. Go to `Add > Add Existing Item...`.
1. Choose the `<classname>Fs.fs` file you generated. Hit "OK".

OR

1. Have Visual Studio Code installed with the `Ionide-fsharp` extension.
1. Open the Godot directory in your workspace. Ionide's F# solution tab should
automatically detect and add the F# project.
1. In the F# tab on the left, you should see your project's .sln and under it the .csproj / .fsproj directories.
1. Right-click the F# project directory. Choose `Add file`.
1. Within the command pallete line edit, type out the name of the F# source file in that directory you want to add. Hit `Enter`.

The F# source file is now added to the F# project!
